# First Session

This first session we talked about the fundamentals of the OOP. It includes:

* Classes vs Objects
* Relations between objects
* Static methods
* Interfaces
* Inheritance

To explain those concepts we tried to model as simple as posible the Adalab academic structure and added some functionalities trying to compare with a more structurated approach.

In order to see inheritance and interfaces, we also created some geometrical shapes.

Finally I define the responsibilites a collections should have to implement a [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) and a [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) for homework.
[You can find the interface in here](../../src/tad/Collection.ts)
